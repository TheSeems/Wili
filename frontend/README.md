# Wili Frontend

## Stack

- Svelte/Typescript for modern web development
- shadcn-svelte as UI library
- OpenAPI

## Approach

- Spec-first development. First, create a spec, then generate (or regenerate) client or server endpoints and use it. Same spec, client for frontend, server endpoints for backend
