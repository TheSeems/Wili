## Getting started

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

Use the automated setup script for a complete development environment:

```bash
./scripts/setup-dev.sh
```

This will set up Podman containers for PostgreSQL and MongoDB, create databases, and generate `.env` files.

### Manual Setup

1) Frontend
- cd frontend
- pnpm install
- cp .env.example .env (adjust values)
- pnpm dev

2) Backend (local)
- Requires Postgres (user svc) and MongoDB (wishlist svc)
- Set env vars (e.g. DB, JWT_SIGNING_KEY, YANDEX_CLIENT_ID/SECRET)
- cd backend/services/user && go run .
- cd backend/services/wishlist && go run .

## Generate API clients

From frontend/:
- pnpm run generate:api
